Process:
This is an interactive data visualization that was built as a part of the capstone project for my MIM degree using the pre-existing code base. The data was mostly in csv format. The time period from requirement gathering to the end delivery was about 6 months. 

Technologies (Javascript Libraries used)
D3.js, Crossfilter, GoogleCharts

Value Created:
As a result of this visualization the library could answer key questions like
1. At what times of the year are the borrowers most likely to borrow items from the library?
2. What kind of items are the most popular ones amongst the borrowers?
3. For how much time do the borrowers keep the items?
4. Why are certain items in the library more popular as compared to the other items?

These and many more similar questions could be answered looking at the visualization. Using this information, the library administration could make key decisions like when should they stock certain items, what amounts would be sufficient semester wise.
